# data.yaml

# This file stores all the content data to be injected to the template on `gulp`.

# Add your own:
#   If you want to add some entries, follow the same YAML format.
#   Notice the tiny dash (-) everywhere, don't forget to add that character when you are adding your own data.

# Icon:
#   Upon choosing an icon, you must strictly choose a valid icon in FontAwesome and write its name.
#   The list of supported icons is at https://semantic-ui.com/elements/icon.html

# Color:
#   Upon choosing a color, you must strictly choose a valid color provided by Semantic-UI.
#   Ths list of supported colors is at https://semantic-ui.com/usage/theming.html#sitewide-defaults.
#   You will soon find out that there are only two colors left. Bite me!

# Search:
#   Upon choosing a search engine, you must check its url and write correct url and key

# List and sub-list:
#   You can build a top-level list of links and a second-level list. No more levels will be used.
#   An entry in a top-level list can have no url, but the template assumes your entries in every second-level list have urls,
#   because otherwise it will be pointless.

# Bottom message:
#   If you provide a "bottom" string in a category, a info-level message box will be attached to the bottom of the box.

# Have fun!
